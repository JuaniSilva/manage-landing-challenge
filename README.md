## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [Astro](https://astro.build/) - Astro is an all-in-one web framework for building fast, content-focused websites.
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Building this landing I learned astro since it was my first time using it. Also learned to style list numbers markers which was a solution that I hadn't tried before (maybe it wasn't the best solution but my goal was to experiment with it)

### Continued development

I still need to finish the input validation and add some background images but I'm happy with the result I achieved. On the other hand, the slider needs some finals touches which I will try to find out how to fix the minor bug it has.
